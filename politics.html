            <p style="margin-left: 10px;"><b>How China Views the US Presidential Election</b><br>Though Chinese leaders are watching the US presidential election closely, they have already convinced themselves that the next American administration will be antagonistic.<br>This view should come as no surprise in Washington. After all, US President Joe Biden followed the Trump administration in imposing new tariffs and restrictions on technology exports, while also expanding anti-China alliances with partners like Japan, South Korea, Australia, and even India.<br>

                But this is not to suggest that China views the two parties as effectively the same. <br>On the contrary, it appears to be preparing to meet the challenges that would come with a second Donald Trump presidency. <br>Trump remains a slight favorite to win, and China’s leaders believe it is more important to prepare early for a new Trump administration than for a victory by the Democrats’ presumptive nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.<br>China’s desire for stability – both in relations with the United States and in the international system more generally – remains strong, because its economy has been slow to re-emerge from the traumas inflicted by the CPC’s draconian lockdown policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. <br>The official line from Chinese authorities is that a further closure of US markets – which is more likely if Trump wins – would force China to double down on strengthening its own consumer markets and shifting toward other foreign markets.<br> The implication is that China itself would not escalate a trade war.<br><a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/chinese-preparations-for-new-us-president-by-ian-bremmer-" style="text-decoration:none;margin-top: 10px;">Read more</a></p>
