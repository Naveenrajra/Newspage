            The 29-year-old, who was disqualified for being 100gm overweight ahead of her 50kg category gold medal bout in the Olympics on Wednesday, announced her decision to retire on social media, saying she doesn't have the strength to continue anymore.<br><a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;">Read more</a></p>

        <b style="color: crimson;font-size: larger;font-weight: 800;">Hockey: Goalie Sreejesh helps India to consecutive Olympic bronze in final appearance</b>
        <p>PARIS: It was emotional. It was epochal. But above everything, it was cathartic. The pall of gloom that descended over India finally cleared on Thursday for some cheer. If it was wrestling that broke Indian hearts, it was hockey that lifted it. The azure astroturf gave India a fourth medal at the Paris Olympic Games, a week after Swapnil Kusale had won the third.

            After everything that had happened over the past couple of days, that bronze was worth its weight in gold.
            
            That last-minute goal at the end of the second quarter spurred the team on. They wanted to win for PR Sreejesh, the trusted custodian of India's fortunes and one of the greatest goalkeepers of his generation, who was playing his final game.</p>

            A spirited Sri Lanka used conditions to their advantage as their spinners bamboozled the Indian batters on slow and turning pitches to register a 2-0 win in the three-ODI series following a 110-run loss in the final game.
            
            "I don't see there is a lack of effort in how we want to try and play different shots. You saw some of these guys played reverse sweep, paddle and all that Â— that is not the nature of their batsmanship," Rohit told the media after his team were shot out for 138 in pursuit of 249 in the third ODI here on Wednesday.<br><a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;color: red;">Read more</a></p>
